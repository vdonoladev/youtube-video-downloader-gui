YouTube Video Downloader Application Using Python

---

We have created two entry widgets, one to ask the user to enter URL or link of YouTube video and others to add that link.

Then, we have called the download function using the “Download Video” button.

You can download the pytube module using "pip install pytube" but if this gives you the error then you should try "pip install pytube3" inside your terminal.
